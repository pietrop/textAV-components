# Module: Post to Twitter Video [Open Source]

As part of [textAV '18 "Full Fact - tweet that clip"](https://textav.gitbook.io/textav-event-2018/unconference-projects/full-fact-tweet-that-clip) prototype. 

We made [`tweet-that-clip`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tweet-that-clip), which is a clean up and refactor of [`quickQuoteNode`](https://github.com/pietrop/quickQuoteNode/tree/master/lib/interactive_video_components/export/twitter_video) underlying twitter video component.

For more on [`quickQuote` for background see here](http://pietropassarelli.com/quickQuote.html) and screenshot of the UI, altho version at the link was built in ruby on rails and didn't have the post to twitter functionality, while `quickQuoteNode` was a later node refactor (express web app), with the post to twitter functionality added to it .

Currently playing around with a branch of of [autoEdit - `tweet-that-clip` ](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/autoEdit_2/tree/tweet-that-clip) to add tweeting a clip functionality to it.
