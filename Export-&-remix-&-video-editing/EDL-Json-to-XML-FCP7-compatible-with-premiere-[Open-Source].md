# EDL Json to XML FCP7 (compatible with premiere) [Open Source]

This could be separate module or use strategy pattern/template pattern to add this export to https://trello.com/c/Eq6gAOYe/4-edl-composer-from-json-edl.

Use case for this, is that if you have two or more track of video EDL has limitations of 1 video track max, and you therefore hit the sealing.


see example of making FCP7 XML in this other module
