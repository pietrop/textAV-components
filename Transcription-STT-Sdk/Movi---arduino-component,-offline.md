>Which shouldn't be interpreted to mean that we're not living in the golden age of speech technology. This month, Friedland helped launch MOVI, a Kickstarted speech recognizer/voice synthesizer for Arduino that operates without the use of the cloud. "It doesn't use the Internet," Friedland says. "You don't have to use the cloud to do recognition. It can work with a couple hundred sentences and it adapts." He laughs at Sony, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and other companies that send speech into the cloud for processing. "All of this is exploiting the fact that people think [voice recognition] is so hard that it has to get done in the cloud. If you have one speaker speaking into a computer, we should consider this problem solved."
