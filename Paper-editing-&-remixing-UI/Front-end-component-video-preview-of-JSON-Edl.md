# Front end component: video preview of JSON Edl

This is similar/same to popcorn js sequence 

example usage is hyperaud.io pad preview component.

https://github.com/rwaldron/popcorn.sequence

Given a JSON EDL of clip selections from multiple clips, it should create a video element (or a canvas that mimics it?) that plays those clips selections, with normal video controllers, and timeline to seek across preview etc...
