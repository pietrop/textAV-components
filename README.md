# README

This repository, uses [`trello-to-markdown`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/trello-to-markdown) to pull data from trello board [`TextAV Audio and Video Components (ongoing)`](https://trello.com/b/58mo9Tpa/textav-audio-and-video-components-ongoing) and formats it so that it can be [synced with gitbook for easier browsing through the projects](https://pietropassarelli.gitbooks.io/textav-audio-and-video-components-ongoing/content/)
