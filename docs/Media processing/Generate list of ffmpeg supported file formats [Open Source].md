### Brief description 
*A paragraph describing in a nutshell what the project does. Context and relevance.*

Example use case, in an AV app, like autoEdit, where ffmpeg is used to process video or audio files and want to leverage the vast amount of file types supported, it's tricky to find a comprehensive list to do file validation. 

This script generates a list (array) that can be used for this purpose. 

usage: Either just get the ready made list in the example folder, or make your own if you have a different version of ffmpeg installed locally.

You can also require this module and use it within your project to generate the list on the fly with your local version of ffmpeg. It also supports setting the path for the ffmpeg binary, for use cases such as wehn working with nwjs or electron.

### Stage of production: 
*eg, prototype, working app, rolled out with users etc..*

Initial draft 

### Any blockers?

Feedback welcome on

- Does the README make sense? 
- Are there any typos?
- Is the code clear enough?
- Does the testing need to be more comprehensive?
- Any use cases I haven't considered that might require extra or different features.
