# Transcriber module

A module to abstract the transcription functionality from STT services and present a consistent interface to use within your app 

https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/autoEdit_2/tree/4e084a8367a9e295cb0c8e14b32aaae9b15c7cbf/lib/interactive_transcription_generator/transcriber

It has sub modules for trimming, splitting, converting video to audio of the specs of the STT service etc.. that should perhaps be extracted separately.
