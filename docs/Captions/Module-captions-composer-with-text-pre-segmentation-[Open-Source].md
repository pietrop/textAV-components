# Module: captions composer (with text pre-segmentation) [Open Source]

The idea is basically if you have a transcription Json ( for simplicity's sake let's assume in it's simplest form as an array of word objects with Start and end timecode attributes) how to create an srt where the lines/words  are well spaced and timed appropriately, automatically .  If that makes sense?

Could refactor this:

on npm

or might be that using [Aeneas as described in this card](https://trello.com/c/6SWhxGTR) might be enough?
