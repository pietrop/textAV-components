# Module: punctuation and capitalisation. [Open Source]

A module to use with raw captions eg from opened captions (that don't have capitalisation or punctuation) or STT outputs (which generally have capitalisation but no punctuation).

and return text with best guess punctuation 
and capitalisation of entities and after full strops. 

this could be two separate modules that can be combined. 

might need a open source entities recognition for auto-capitalisation (if there is one or to connect with payed API).
